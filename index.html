        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm a child of the southeast. I've got a few bad habits but I try to treat people well and take care of my family. I've grown up in the movies and as an adult started <a href="http://filmdispenser.com/" target="_blank">FilmDispenser.com</a>; a community for like-minded pop culture enthusiasts. Podcasting became a way of life but filmmaking was the goal and web design a byproduct. I've put the mic down and picked up a camera. My first short, <i>Say Hello</i> played at the 2016 Chattanooga Film Festival and the first Way Down Short Film Festival in Columbus, GA. I'm working on my fourth short now and a new career in web design, and I'm most excited for what is to come from finally putting my heart into all of the work I do.</p>
        <p>I'm married to a beautiful <a href="http://katehowphoto.com/" target="_blank">photographer, Katy Howard</a>. We have one son and he's a little over a year old. I named him Ezra after the Star Wars Rebels character, which should fill in a few blanks about myself. My years at FilmDispenser.com have lead me to chase all of my passions. Come on this journey with me, won't you?</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to take my experiences and passions and mash them together in the form of possibility. I want to make things, and better myself and my skills in the process. I'm working on:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Magic</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
          <li>Web Design</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>App Development</li>
          <li>Hope</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, I'd like to work for myself helping clients connect and share in the most stunning ways imaginable while moonlighting as a secret director of shortened cinema.</p>
